      <h2> Segal Quote of the Month </h>
        <p> I would say the same thing, just to be polite.
          Let me tell you something that might be a bit dangerous.
          I was raised in Japan. I was schooled in martial arts. I was given
          the title of master. They take a movie “The Last Samurai.” They have a
         5-foot-2-inch little guy, whether he was straight or gay, I don’t know.
         I don’t care. He had never been to Japan. He doesn’t speak Japanese. He
         has never held a sword. They make him the Last Samurai. We got 450,000 phone
         calls [laughs] from everybody in the world saying, “That role was perfect for
         you. How did that happen?” Most of the people I know didn’t like the film and
         didn’t go see it. It’s just a classic example of Hollywood and the politics.
         -On Tom Cruise starring in The Last Samuraii.</p>
